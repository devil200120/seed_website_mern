              <h2>From Humble Beginnings to Global Success</h2>
              <p>
                Field to Feed Export began in 2009 with a simple yet powerful
                vision: to connect the rich agricultural heritage of India with
                global markets while ensuring fair compensation for our farmers
                and premium quality for our international customers.
              </p>

              <h3>The Founding Years (2009-2012)</h3>
              <p>
                Our founder, started with just 10 farmer partners in
                Maharashtra, focusing primarily on spice exports. The early
                years were challenging, but our commitment to quality and
                ethical practices quickly earned us recognition in the
                international market.
              </p>

              <h3>Expansion Phase (2013-2018)</h3>
              <p>
                By 2013, we had expanded to work with over 100 farmers across
                multiple states. We diversified our product range to include
                fresh fruits, vegetables, grains, and pulses. This period marked
                our entry into European and Middle Eastern markets.
              </p>

              <h3>Technology Integration (2019-2021)</h3>
              <p>
                We invested heavily in modern processing facilities, quality
                testing laboratories, and cold chain logistics. This
                technological advancement allowed us to maintain the highest
                quality standards while scaling our operations significantly.
              </p>

              <h3>Global Recognition (2022-Present)</h3>
              <p>
                Today, we proudly serve customers in over 50 countries, work
                with 500+ farmers, and maintain certifications from leading
                international quality organizations. Our story continues as we
